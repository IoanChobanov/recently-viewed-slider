# Recently Viewed Products Slider (Flatsome + LSCache-ready)

This plugin was created as a small **personal experiment** for my own WooCommerce website [shopbg-zdrave.com](https://shopbg-zdrave.com), to explore and better understand **WordPress plugin development**, **WooCommerce hooks**, and **Flatsome theme integration**.

It adds a simple, responsive **"Recently Viewed Products" slider** below product pages — styled to fit Flatsome’s design and compatible with **LiteSpeed Cache (ESI private blocks)** for proper per-user caching.

> Built as a learning exercise to deepen my understanding of modern WordPress and WooCommerce development.  
> Not intended for production use outside this context.
